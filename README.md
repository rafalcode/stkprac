Just trying out STK, Sound Synthesizer Toolkit

the sineosc actually uses a wavetable,

it is able to generate difference fequencies base don it 2048bytes, that's 1024 samples (i.e. 2bytes mono)
but I'm unsure if you can just put anything in there.

have to experiemtn with raw files, auacity refuses to save somethign as raw. It's that horrid.
In anycase I would have to make my stereo samples mono first.
